Currently based in Los Angeles, CA.

I consider adventure to be a big part of my identity -- not only the thrill-seeking kind, but also the state of mind that allows me to lead a life of exploration. Some of this appetite is satisfied by biking and traveling.

Among other things, I enjoy hiking, the beach, spending time with my dog and girlfriend, learning about new science and technology, and thinking about personal growth.
