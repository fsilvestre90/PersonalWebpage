Currently based in Los Angeles, CA.

I consider adventure to be a big part of my identity -- not only the thrill-seeking kind, but also the state of mind that allows me to lead a life of exploration. Some of this appetite is satisfied by biking and traveling. One of my long term goals is to attain enough financial independence to lead a life that primarily involves adventure in some capacity. At that point, I'll gladly give up my current one that involves hours looking at a computer screen every day.

Among other things, I enjoy hiking, the beach, spending time with my dog and girlfriend, learning about new science and technology, and thinking about personal growth.
